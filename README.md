# Classic Melee [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LepkoQQ/ClassicMelee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LepkoQQ/ClassicMelee)

Allows you to change melee mechanics to be more like in older Minecraft versions.

### Features:
* (optional) Remove swing cooldown on all weapons
* (optional) Nerf damage based on the removed swing speed (so items like axes are not stronger than swords)
